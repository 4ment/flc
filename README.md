# Installing FLC

FLC is a package for BEAST 2, so it assumes you already have BEAST 2 installed. If you have not already done so, you can get BEAST 2 from [here](http://www.beast2.org).

To see where add-ons are installed launch BEAUTi, click the button with question mark in the dialogâ€™s bottom right corner. A new dialog is shown with the information where you can find add-ons. Different operating systems have different locations where the add-ons are installed. [More info](https://www.beast2.org/managing-packages/).

Unzip the latest [release](https://github.com/4ment/flc/releases) in the add-directory.

If you have multiple versions of BEAST and the add-on was installed with BEAUTi v2.5 the add-on will be only available for BEAST v2.5. Add-ons need to be installed for each version.
