# Installing FLC

FLC is a package for BEAST 2, so it assumes you already have BEAST 2 installed. If you have not already done so, you can get BEAST 2 from [here](http://www.beast2.org).

There are two ways to install a package in BEAST2:

## The easy way (recommended) is to let BEAUTi install everything for you.

The BEAST2 website has a blog [post](https://www.beast2.org/managing-packages/) dedicated to this task. This package is not part of the official package repository so you need to register this package first.

- Open BEAUTi, click on `Manage Packages` menu the in the `File` menu. This will open a window showing the package names.
- Locate and select the package name `FLC` in the table and click the `Install/Upgrade` button.
- Close the window et voila the package should be installed.

## The hard way is to install manually the package: 
To see where add-ons are installed launch BEAUTi, click the button with question mark in the dialogâ€™s bottom right corner. A new dialog is shown with the information where you can find add-ons. Different operating systems have different locations where the add-ons are installed. [More info](https://www.beast2.org/managing-packages/).

Unzip the latest [release](https://github.com/4ment/flc/releases) in the add-on directory.

If you have multiple versions of BEAST and the add-on was installed with BEAUTi v2.5 the add-on will be only available for BEAST v2.5. Add-ons need to be installed for each version.
